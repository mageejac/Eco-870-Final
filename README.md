# Eco-870-Final

This repository contains the raw data and Program R code used to analyze the relationship between group size and cover type. 

The data package with metadata for my observational deer data (DBS_2022_RAW.csv) can be found at (https://tinyurl.com/2kxrfgss) or by downloading the Spatial Patterns of White-Tailed Deer Congregations in Response to Cover Type in Southcentral Michigan (2).zip file from the repository. 

Final Paper Code 870.RMD will provide annotated code to rerun my analysis and with the raw data and reproduce my results. 

Step_1_Script.R and Step_2_Script.R are subsets of the markdown code to make the work flow easier to follow but running the code in the markdown document will lead to the same results. 

All of the figures (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3) from my paper are also availible in the repository, as well as a copy of my workflow diagram. 

Metadata for the USDA Crop Cover Layer can be found at https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/metadata/metadata_mi21.htm
